        <p><font size="-1">It is our policy to respond to clear notices of alleged
            copyright infringement. This page describes the information that
            should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting
            notices of alleged infringement to WordPong as straightforward as possible
            while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent
            or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified
            below is consistent with the form suggested by the United States
            Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the text of which can be found
            at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site, <a href="http://www.copyright.gov">http://www.copyright.gov</a>)
            but we will respond to notices of this form from other jurisdictions
        as well.</font></p> 
        <p><font size="-1">Regardless of whether we may be liable for such infringement
            under local country law or United States law, our response to these
            notices may include removing or disabling access to material claimed
            to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating subscribers.
            If we remove or disable access in response to such a notice, we will
            make a good-faith attempt to contact the owner or administrator of
            the affected site or content so that they may make a counter notification.
            We may also document notices of alleged infringement on which we
            act. Please note that in addition to being forwarded to the person who provided the allegedly infringing content, a copy of this legal notice may be sent to a third-party which may publish and/or annotate it.
As such, your letter (with your personal information removed) may be forwarded to Chilling Effects (<a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org">http://www.chillingeffects.org</a>) for publication. You can see an example of such a publication at <a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca512/notice.cgi?NoticeID=861">http://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca512/notice.cgi?NoticeID=861</a>.

        <p><font size="-1">To file a notice of infringement with us, you must
            provide a written communication (by regular mail -- not by
            email, except by prior agreement) that sets forth the items specified
            below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including
            costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that a
            product or activity is infringing your copyrights. Indeed, 
            in a past case (please see <a href="http://www.onlinepolicy.org/action/legpolicy/opg_v_diebold/">http://www.onlinepolicy.org/action/legpolicy/opg_v_diebold/</a>          for more information), a company that sent an infringement notification
            seeking removal of online materials that were protected by the fair
            use doctrine was ordered to pay such costs and attorneys fees. The
            company agreed to pay over $100,000. Accordingly, if you are not
            sure whether material available online infringes your copyright,
        we suggest that you first contact an attorney.</font></p> 
        <p><font size="-1">To expedite our ability to process your request, please 
          use the following format (including section numbers):</font></p> 
        <p><b>1.</b><font size="-1"> Identify in sufficient detail the copyrighted
            work that you believe has been infringed upon (for example, &quot;The
            copyrighted work at issue is the text that appears on http://www.legal.com/legal_page.html&quot;)
            or other information sufficient to specify the copyrighted work being
            infringed (for example, &quot;The copyrighted work at issue is the &#8220;Touch
            Not This Cat&#8221; by Dudley Smith, published by Smith Publishing,
        ISBN #0123456789&quot;).</font></p>

            THAT DIRECTLY LINKS TO A WEB PAGE THAT ALLEGEDLY CONTAINS INFRINGING

        you used, and (b) the URL for each allegedly infringing search result.</font></p> 
        <p><font size="-1">For example, suppose (hypothetically) that you conducted

            you believe infringes the copyrighted text you identified in item
        #1 above. In this case, you would provide the following information:</font></p>
