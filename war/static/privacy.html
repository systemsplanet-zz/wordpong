<h3>Information we collect and how we use it</h3>
<p>We may collect the following types of information:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Information you provide</strong> . When you sign up
	for a <a href="/static/tos.html">WordPong Account</a>, we ask you for
	personal information. We may combine the information you submit under
	your account with information from other WordPong services or third
	parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve
	the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the
	opportunity to opt out of combining such information.
	<li><strong>Cookies</strong> . When you visit WordPong, we send
	one or more cookies to your computer or other device. We use cookies to
	improve the quality of our service, including for storing user
	preferences, improving search results and ad selection, and tracking
	user trends, such as how people play. WordPong also uses cookies in its
	advertising services to help advertisers and publishers serve and
	manage ads across the web and on WordPong services.
	<li><strong>Log information</strong> . When you access WordPong
	services via a browser, application or other client our servers
	automatically record certain information. These server logs may include
	information such as your web request, your interaction with a service,
	Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and
	time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify
	your browser or your account.
	<li><strong>User communications</strong> . When you send email or
	other communications to WordPong, we may retain those communications in
	order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve
	our services. When you send and receive SMS messages to or from one of
	our services that provides SMS functionality, we may collect and
	maintain information associated with those messages, such as the phone
	number, the wireless carrier associated with the phone number, the
	content of the message, and the date and time of the transaction. We
	may use your email address to communicate with you about our services.

	
	<li><strong>Affiliated WordPong Services on other sites</strong> .
	We offer some of our services on or through other web sites. Personal
	information that you provide to those sites may be sent to WordPong in
	order to deliver the service. We process such information under this
	Privacy Policy.
	<li><strong>Third Party Applications</strong> . WordPong may make
	available third party applications, such as extensions, through its
	services. The information collected by WordPong when you enable a third
	party application is processed under this Privacy Policy. Information
	collected by the third party application provider is governed by their
	privacy policies.
	<li><strong>Location data</strong> . WordPong may offer
	location-enabled services. If you use those services, WordPong may
	receive information about your actual location (such as GPS signals
	sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate
	a location (such as a cell ID).
	<li><strong>Unique application number</strong> . Certain services
	include a unique application number that is not associated with your
	account or you. This number and information about your installation
	(e.g., operating system type, version number) may be sent to WordPong
	when you install or uninstall that service or when that service
	periodically contacts our servers (for example, to request automatic
	updates to the software).
	<li><strong>Other sites</strong> . This Privacy Policy applies to
	WordPong services only. We do not exercise control over the sites
	displayed as search results, sites that include WordPong applications,
	products or services, or links from within our various services. These
	other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your
	computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.
</ul>

<p>In addition to the above, we may use the information we collect
to:
<ul>
	<li>Provide, maintain, protect, and improve our services
	(including advertising services) and develop new services; and
	<li>Protect the rights or property of WordPong or our users.
</ul>
<p>If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose
for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to
such use.
<p>WordPong processes personal information on our servers in the
United States of America and in other countries. In some cases, we
process personal information outside your own country.
<h3>Choices</h3>
<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can
reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is
being sent. However, some WordPong features and services may not
function properly if your cookies are disabled.
<h3>Information sharing</h3>

<p>WordPong only shares personal information with other companies or
individuals outside of WordPong in the following limited circumstances:


<ul>
	<li>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the
	sharing of any sensitive personal information.
	<li>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated
	companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of
	processing personal information on our behalf. We require that these
	parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and
	in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate
	confidentiality and security measures.
	<li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or
	disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy
	any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable
	governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service,
	including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect,
	prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or
	(d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of WordPong,
	its users or the public as required or permitted by law.
</ul>
<p>If WordPong becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any
form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the
confidentiality of any personal information involved in such
transactions and provide notice before personal information is
transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
<h3>Information security</h3>
<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against
unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or
destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data
collection, storage and processing practices and security measures,
including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard
against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.
<p>We restrict access to personal information to WordPong employees,
contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to
process it on our behalf. These individuals are bound by confidentiality
obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and
criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.
<h3>Accessing and updating personal information</h3>

<p>When you use WordPong services, we make good faith efforts to
provide you with access to your personal information and either to
correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your
request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for
legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify
themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or
removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process
requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require
disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or
would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning
information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not
otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and
correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so
would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain
certain services, after you delete your information, residual copies may
take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers
and may remain in our backup systems. Please review the service Help
Centers for more information.
<h3>Enforcement</h3>
<p>WordPong adheres to the US Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of
Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and
Enforcement <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" rel="nofollow">U.S.
Department of Commerce.s Safe Harbor Program</a>.
<p>WordPong regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy
Policy. When we receive formal written complaints, it is WordPong.s
policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We
will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including
local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding
the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between WordPong
and an individual.
<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to
time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without
your explicit consent. We will post any Privacy Policy changes on this
page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more
prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of
Privacy Policy changes).
